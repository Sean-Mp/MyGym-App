# MyGym-App

Welcome to MyGym app project
This application will be a mobile app that will help users track their workouts, nutrition and a host of related things
The plan for this app starts of as:
1. Create mysql database and create basic user tables
2. Create a node.js API that will serve as the foundation of the backend, this will combine with external apis 
3. Create a hybrid mobile application using the ionic framework

The application itself will allow users to create workouts, add exercises to their workouts, track how often they perform a workout, how long their workout lasts, the sets, reps and weight they do on each exercise, encourage users to progressively overload and so on.
It will also allow users to track their nutrition and give a break down of their nutritional intake, this will be done using an external API called fatsecret platform

Thats the initial plan. More will be added as I progress through this application development
